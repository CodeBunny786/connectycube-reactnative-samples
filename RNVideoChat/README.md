## Quick start and develop

Quick start [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) app.

Prepare environment for React Native and:

1. Clone the project;
2. Install node_modules from connectycube-js-samples/RNVideoChat - `npm install`;
3. Run `npm run ios` or `npm run android`.

## Running on a device

The above command will automatically run your app on the iOS Simulator by default. If you want to run the app on an actual physical iOS device, please follow the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/running-on-device).
